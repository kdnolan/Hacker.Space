"If you are looking for block type programs to use with the actual EV3s, you can use either the 'EV3 Classroom' or 'EV3 Lab'. EV3 classroom is more friendly but the EV3 lab has more functionality. For classroom use, I will suggest the EV3 classroom. Both have tutorials. Here is the link. https://education.lego.com/en-us/downloads/retiredproducts
If you are after simulation, I suggest 'Gearsbot'. Here is the link. https://gears.aposteriori.com.sg/
